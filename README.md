# Big Brain Award Challenge

Welcome to the **Big Brain Award Challenge!**

I won't tell you exactly what has to be done. All you need to know is that the first pull request (PR) with an implementation of the answer that passes both test cases wins. Simple as that!

## How to Get Started

1. **Inspect the Files**: Take a look at the provided files in this repository. They contain everything you need to understand the challenge.
2. **Implement Your Solution**: Once you have figured out what needs to be done, go ahead and implement your solution.
3. **Run the Tests**: Make sure your implementation passes both test cases. You can find the test cases in the designated test files.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: When you're ready, submit your PR with your implementation.

## Rules

- The first PR that successfully passes both test cases will be declared the winner.
- Have fun and be creative with your solutions!

## Good Luck!

May the **BIGGEST** brain win!
